Java Installation:
------------------
1-Before installation go to C:\Program Files and check if Java folder is present. 
If not proceed with Java installation as per next steps (if Win 32bit then check C:\Program Files (x86))
2-Go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and download the latest Java JDK (currently Java SE 9.0.4)
3-Install Java (next, next and confirm)

Configure Java Path in System Variables
----------------------------------------
4-Go to its folder on C:\Program Files\Java and open the JDK Folder
5-Copy the path and go to Advanced System Settings of My Computer
6-Select Environmental Variables and select to create new one
7-Name the new variable "JAVA_HOME" and paste the path copied earlier
8-Go to Java folder again and select the bin folder
9-Copy its path and go to environmental variables and add this path to a variable called "PATH"
10-To test Java installation and configuration open command prompt and type the following command "java -version", it should return
the current Java version (9.0.4)

Eclipse IDE Installation
-------------------------
11-Go to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/ and download Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (64bit)
12-Unzip the downloaded folder and launch Eclipse.exe within it

Create New Eclipse Project
--------------------------
Note: A project is a test suite (collection of test cases). Each test case is a java class.
13-Once Eclipse is launched click on "Work Bench" button
14-Create new Java Project, next then finish (Test Suite is created)
15-Expand the project and create new class under the SRC (Test Case is created)
Note: Enable method "public static main void" and click finish

Selenium JARs Download and Configuration
----------------------------------------
16-Go to https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
17-Under Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings download the Java version
18-Once completed, open your Java project properties (right click)
19-Select Jave Build Path, Libraries Tab (ClassPath) and add external JARs
20-Add all JARs from selenium downloaded folder (inside and outside the libs folder)

Running Tests in any browser
------------------------------
21-Use the driver needed in your script for the selected browser 
(ex: Google Chrome use ChromeDriver, Microsoft Edge use EdgeDriver, etc...)
22-Go to https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ and download the Google Chrome Driver
23-Then configure your script based on the location of the extracted file

TestNG (Test Cases Management)
--------------------------------
24-Go back to Eclipse, Help, Install New Software
25-Go to Testng.org, select selenium, Installation and follow instructions (http://beust.com/eclipse)
26-Copy the URL given and paste it in Work With section
27-Wait till TestNG is shown
28-Select it and proceed
29-Finish installation and restart Eclipse IDE
30-To test if TestNG was installed open Eclipse and select Windows, preferences then search for TestNG
31-To run tests using TestNG add the annotation @Test and no need to select public static void when creating a new test (Create a Project, Package, Class)
Note: after each @Test is considered a test case by itself
Note: Project Example OMTPortal - Package Example Login Module - Class Example Valid_Login - Then add all the tests under the class
32-Each Class can be considered as set of test cases under a test suite. To execute all batches of test cases under a test suite
then convert the whole testsuite to XML (Convert to TestNG) and then execute the tests from there.
Note: the XML file should be on project level and not package level / test suite
33-To exclude one batch of test cases from execution then remove it from the XML File
34-To remove a single test under a batch then specify the method under the class, name it then exclude it. Similarly you can
only include specific tests
Example:
  <test thread-count="5" name="Beginners Tests">
    <classes>
      <class name="TestCases.SecondTest"/>
      <class name="TestCases.FirstTest">
      	<methods>
      		<include name="SecondTestCase"/>
      	</methods>
      </class>
    </classes>
  </test> 

35-Naming Convention for tests should start with Method Name. We use Regular Expression in the XML file to exclude or include 
certain tests that contains a keyword such as <exclude name="Mobile.*">
36-Use the annotation @BeforeTest as a pre-requisite for the Test block (regardless of its position in the plan)
37-Use the annotation @AfterTest as the ending test (regardless of its position in the plan)

Listeners
--------------------------------
Note:Listerns are used to take an action when something occurs (ex: take a snapshot when an error occurs)
39-First Create a Listener Class under your project (ex: public class Listeners implements ITestListener)
40-Then from the XML Controller link the listener to it
41-
