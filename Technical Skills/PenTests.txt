-Threat Modeling
-Vulnerability Analysis
-Exploitation
-Post Exploitation
-Reporting

1-Planning and Scoping: 
	-Get the permission (written authorization) else you will be penalized. If the application is cloud hosted then you need to get authorization from the 
	 hosting as well (third party permissions)
	-know how much work you have to do (not too little and not too much)
	-Watch out for scope creep (uncontrolled scope)
	-What to attack (specify the most import and productive tests)

	It starts with setting a Project Management Plan. It has a specific set of goals with starting and ending point.
	In your plan it important to: 
	-define your audience (who is the organization)
	-Why they need the pentest (legislation need, ISO need)
	-Define the rules of engagement (attacking the system may result in damanges). Things you care about include the starting time allowed, stop, restrictions 
	 (attack allowed at night only), and document the expected impact of pen tests
	-PenTest risks (crashing devices, data corruption, degrading performance
	-Test Scope: Technical, physical (telephone calls) 
	-Communicate as much as possible with the client (when and with who especially in case something goes wrong) and how often 
	 (ex: upon each vulnerability or daily)
	-Set an accurate budget (time and cost). More tests needed means more budget
	-Define who provides the resources (laptops, PCs, tablets, other devices needed)
	-Environment Knowledge (Blackbox vs. Whitebox): 
		-Check WSDL or WADL files (web services definition language - web application definition language) which
	 	 defines the functions within the applications --> usually published publicly
		-Check SOAP project files (web services) 
		-SDK documentation (software development kit)
		-REST APIs (swagger documentation)
		-XSD (xml schema definition)
		-Check examples on the above (how the request and response should look like and accordingly define a bad request with inappropriate parameters)
		-Architectural Document (network diagrams, application and DB diagrams)
	-Legal Contract Constraints:
		-Statement of Work (SOW) what tasks are to be accomplished
		-Master service agreement (MSA) specific details of arrangement (payment details)
		-Non disclosure agreement (NDA) confidentiality, restrictions, and info sharing

2-Pen Test Target Classes include: Host, Network, Domains, Users, Applications, Services, Web pages and tokens. Scanning is used to determine what areas to attack
or were are the exploits / vulnerabilities are (info gathering) --> Use zenmap tool
