-Quantitative Data or Numerical data
---------------------------------------
1-Discrete (count of events, whole numbers)
2-Continuous (infinite number of possibilities, decimal)
	
-Categorical Data or Qualitative (ex: gender, race, etc...)

-Ordinal (mixture of categorical and numerical)
	ex: movie rating (1,2,3,4,5 but they have meaning 1 lowest, 5 highest)


-Statistics
--------------------------------------------
	-Mean (Average)
	-Median: Middle value
		Odd Count: middle value, extracted after sorting
		Even Count: average of the 2 middle values after sorting
	-Mode: Most common value in a data set (frequent) --> it needs discrete data
	-Standard Deviation
	-Variance: Known as SIGMA SQUARE. How the spread out of data is. Average of the squared 				  differences from the mean
	ex: Data Set = [1,2,3,4,5,6] --> whole population
	    Mean = 1+2+3+4+5+6 / 6 = 3.5
	    Difference from the mean = [-2.5,-1.5,-0.5,0.5,1.5,2.5]
	    Squared Difference = 6.25+1.5625+0.25+0.25+1.5625+6.25 = 16.125
	    Mean(Sum of squared difference) = 16.125 / 6 = 2.6875
	-Standard Deviation = square root of the variance (SIGMA). How many sigmas away from the mean
				SquareRoot(2.6875) = 1.6393

	ex: in case of sample data extracted from the population (subset)
	    It is calculated by Sum of Squared Difference / count - 1
	    in previous case = 16.125 / 5 instead of 6 = 3.225
	    Known as Sample Variance S2(S Squared)
	-Probability: chance of occurance
	-Percentile: Percentage at which others are less than that (ex: 99% of salaries in Lebanon are less than 6000 USD, 1% are more)
	-Moment: Quantitative measure of the shape of probability density function
		The first moment is the mean
		The second moment is the variance
		3rd Moment is the skew
		4th is kurtosis, how thick the tail and how sharp the peak
